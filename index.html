<h4>About Me</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>
As the owner of a company, I work closely with my team to complete a multitude of projects. One of my jobs as the lead of the company is web development. A favorite part of me being an artist is being able to put together my portfolio websites for people and customers to view.
<br>
<br>
As I already have some programming background knowledge and am continuing to grow, I am excited to work with new people on new software projects. Please feel free to reach out if you are looking to hire a new developer. </p>
